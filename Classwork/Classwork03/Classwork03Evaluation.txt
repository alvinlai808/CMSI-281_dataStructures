Classwork03 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

+ you could have added a few more tests, but who's counting...
+ you need a LOT more code in here to make things work the way
   the specification says.  It's an "in-class" exercise, so I
   won't be grading it the way I will your homework, but you
   WILL lose points on homework assignments if you don't do
   things the way they are specified.  For example, in the
   append() method, if the list is too small you are supposed
   to INCREASE the size of the list, not just throw an exception
+ your code looks very nice...
