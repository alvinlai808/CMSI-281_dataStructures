Classwork01 Evaluation
======================

Nice job on this assignment, with a couple of comments:

There are TABS in this code.  Baaaaadddd...

Also, your repository structure is incorrect.  Please take a
look at the Assignment Submissions section of the week 01 web
page and make your structure look like that one.

When you get your repo set up correctly. put this file in the
"classwork01" folder.

Still, you get 96% out of 100% on this.
